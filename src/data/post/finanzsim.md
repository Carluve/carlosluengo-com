Meet FinanzSim: My Educational Financial Management Simulator

_An AI-powered web app I built to help business students master financial concepts through hands-on simulation._

---

## What Is FinanzSim?

**FinanzSim** is an interactive web-based simulator designed specifically for first-year Business Studies students. The application allows learners to experience the complexities of managing a company's finances across multiple years, making strategic decisions and observing their real-time impact on key financial indicators.

Think of it as a sandbox where students can safely experiment with financial strategies, learn from their mistakes, and receive instant AI-generated feedback without any real-world consequences.

## Objectives

I built FinanzSim with several clear goals in mind:

1. **Bridge Theory and Practice** — Transform abstract financial formulas into tangible, interactive experiences that students can explore hands-on.
2. **Develop Strategic Thinking** — Help students understand how decisions about pricing, costs, investments, and financing ripple through the entire financial structure of a business.
3. **Provide Instant Feedback** — Leverage AI to deliver personalised, real-time analysis after each simulated year, as if they had a virtual professor by their side.
4. **Demystify Financial Ratios** — Make complex metrics like ROA, ROE, liquidity ratios, and leverage accessible through visual dashboards and clear explanations.
5. **Encourage Experimentation** — Create a risk-free environment where making mistakes is part of the learning journey.

## How It Works

### Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Timeframe** — Select how many years you want to simulate (from 1 to 12 years).
2. **Start with Initial Capital** — Your company begins with a treasury of **100,000 €**.

### Year-by-Year Management

For each simulated year, you'll make key business decisions:

| Decision            | Description                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Units Sold**      | How many units of product you expect to sell       |
| **Unit Price**      | Your selling price per unit                        |
| **Variable Costs**  | Cost per unit produced                             |
| **Fixed Costs**     | Overheads that don't change with production volume |
| **New Investment**  | Capital expenditure on assets                      |
| **New Loans**       | Additional debt financing                          |
| **New Equity**      | Fresh capital injection                            |
| **Collection Days** | How long customers take to pay you                 |
| **Payment Days**    | How long you take to pay suppliers                 |

### Real-Time Financial Analysis

After submitting your decisions for each year, FinanzSim calculates and displays:

- **Income Statement** — Revenue, EBIT, EBT, Net Income
- **Balance Sheet** — Assets, Liabilities, Equity
- **Break-Even Analysis** — How many units you need to sell to cover costs
- **Key Ratios** — ROA, ROE, Leverage, Liquidity, Solvency
- **Cash Flow** — For NPV calculations
- **Working Capital Cycle (PMM)** — Storage, manufacturing, sales, and collection periods

### AI-Powered Professor Feedback

Here's where it gets interesting! After each year, an **AI professor** analyses your results and provides:

- Commentary on your financial performance
- Identification of potential risks
- Suggestions for improvement
- Comparison to typical business benchmarks

---

### Final Executive Report

Once you complete all simulation years, you can generate a **comprehensive executive report** that includes:

- Full performance analysis across all periods
- Net Present Value (NPV) of your company
- AI-generated strategic summary and recommendations
- Visual charts showing business evolution

## About the Project

FinanzSim is a **research pet project** developed in collaboration with the _Faculty of Economics, Business and Tourism_ at the **University of Alcalá (UAH)** in Spain.

The aim is to explore how AI-enhanced interactive simulations can improve financial literacy amongst university students, making complex concepts more approachable and engaging.

## Final Thoughts

Building FinanzSim has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Combining my passion for education technology with practical financial concepts has created something that I genuinely believe helps students learn.
